I just text them “all good” when they cancel.  I honestly don’t want to date anymore as I’m just losing money for shit company right now.  Do you guys have any advice for me?

Losing weight, eating healthy, taking care of myself mentally and physically and spiritually. But getting the apnea under control revealed a second sort of horror. I can only get 2-4 hours of sleep a night; it is extremely light and filled with terrifying nightmares that are so vivid they feel more real than reality.

To put it succinctly, I've never let go of anything and just held that burning coal in my hand until it roasted me all the way through.

And I was not raised like some people where I was yelled at not to cry or that \"boys don't cry.\" I just don't know what it is. I get the feeling I just won't let myself truly cry it out because I might feel weak or vulnerable and I have been through a great deal of hardship and trauma by pushing down and always just pushing forward and steeling myself.

I met this guy last night at a bar in our hometown and we were chatting for a bit. He seemed really cool, but he doesn't live in my hometown anymore. After talking for a bit, I learned some details about him that made it easier to find him. All I did was write his first name into facebook with the city he lives in now and because we have some mutual friends, he popped up first in the search. Would it be creepy to add him on facebook since he never gave me his last name or is this okay? \n",

In the function there is a while loop that I set in order to stop the scraping once a certain number of posts had been reached.  I started this off at just 1000 from each thread, but I came back here once I began modeling and increased the number of posts I scraped in order to improve my model.  I did this a few times, saving CSVs of 10,000, 30,000, and 50,000 posts. "
